This simple script runs a few optimizers on a transformer for the IMDB dataset.

2) edit the 2 lines in "main" specifying the config file and the GPU you want to use
3) from a screen in the terminal in the dalab GPU, run  'python3 main.py'
4) see the train logs in your wandb page (you need to do the login first)
